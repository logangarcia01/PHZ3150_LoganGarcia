Installed the Anaconda Navigator. Was quite simple, typed it in on google and hit download. Once it was finished i had all the programs needed (jupyter notebook, etc...)
 URL : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/
 installed on desktop.

Problem 1 (5 points). Make a new folder named hw3_<yourname> under your 
homework folder. For this assignment, your log is now just a part of your homework. In 
one of the entries, it should identify the start and end of HW3 and list the problem 
numbers in order. After each problem number, give your answer and the names of any 
files you are handing in for each problem. If you made a HW3 entry in your log in a prior 
session and want to change it, just copy it to the current (last) session, and edit there. 
We will grade the last entry only. All text related to one assignment should be in one 
entry, with the problems done in order.

Created a Hw3 file on computer, and github.

Problem 2. (30 points total) We will continue our practice using Git. You will add a new 
directory from your computer to a new repository. Remember that to add a new repo 
from the GitHub Desktop app, you can go to File ‚Üí New Repository ‚Üí then, in the pop 
up window name your repository and determine its local path (e.g., in class we pointed 
to where phz3150/ is in your laptop). If you have already set a local repository up, you 
can go to File ‚Üí Add Local Repository. Then you can publish your repository to your 
personal GitHub account (chose ‚Äúorganization: None‚Äù option). If you now go to the 
GitHub webpage, it will appear under your repositories.

a) (5 points) If you haven‚Äôt done so yet, set up the GitHub repository (get the 
GitHub desktop app, and set your name and email for the Git log). Explain how 
you did it in your log (use past notes, or from memory if you did it in the 
classroom last Tuesday).

Created a repository in github by clicking create a repository after setting up an account and naming it PHZ3150_LoganGarcia and made a local path on my laptop.

b) I. (2.5 points) If you haven‚Äôt done so yet, put your course log under 
revision control. In your log explain how you did this in detail (again, use 
past notes, or from memory if you did it in the classroom last Tuesday). 
Your log should contain information about how you added the file to the 
list of files Git keeps a track of, how you committed the file (including the 
commit message) and how you made sure there is a backup on GitHub.

placed course log in repository and is under revision control which means a short summary is needed any time a change is made to it.

II. (2.5 points) Use your favorite browser to navigate to your personal 
GitHub repository. Find your phz3150/ repository and click on it. Make a 
screenshot of the browser showing that the folder contains your log, and 
all the folders of your phz3150/ folder. Rename the screenshot using the 
appropriate naming conventions and add it to your hw3_<yourname>
folder.

took a screen shot showing log was placed in repository.

c) (5 points) Make a new folder named test_git in your computer (can be 
anywhere, you can delete it later on). Put it under revision control. Explain how 
you did this in your log (up to, but not including, publishing it).

Created test_git file on desktop.

d) (1 point) Take file hw1-survey.txt from Webcourses. Move it to your test_git 
folder.
(2 points) Go to the GitHub desktop app. Get a screenshot that shows the status 
of the repository on the GitHub Desktop app (i.e., that something was added). 
(1 point) Commit the change with an informative comment. 
(2 points) Once done, remove the file from the test_git folder. Go to the 
GitHub desktop app. Get a screenshot that shows the status of the repository 
changed (i.e., that something was removed). 
(1 point) Commit the change with an informative comment. 
(1 point) Explain how you did all these to your log. 
(2 points) Rename the screenshots using the appropriate naming conventions 
and add them to your hw3_<yourname> folder.

Added Hw1-survey from webcourses to my test_git file on my repository, opened github app, 
placed a brief summary then commited to main, and pushed orgin. 
then deleted file from folder went back to app put a summary, then comitted to main and pushed to origin again deleting it.

(5 points) Make a screenshot of the commit history for your log (showing all the 
commit messages, when they were made, and by whom).

took screenshot.

Problem 3. (10 points total) Start Jupyter. Navigate to your hw3_<yourname> folder 
and start a new Python 3 notebook. 

(2 points) Change the name of the notebook to hw3_<yourname>.ipynb (remember, 
the extension is automatically set from Jupyter).

(2 points) Use Markdown to write a descriptive text about your notebook at the start of 
the notebook (something like ‚Äúpractice notebook‚Äù ‚Ä¶).

(2 points) Define variable x equal to 10 and variable y equal to 100. Define variable z
equal to the product of x and y and variable w equal to the difference of y and x. Print 
z and w.

(2 points) Make a variable named min that is equal to 3. What do you notice? Is min a 
good name to use for your variable? Why/ why not? Explain in your Jupyter notebook
(make a comment in your notebook using #, do not do it in markdown).

(2 points) Make a variable q equal to 1. Print q. Add one to q. Print q. In one line 
multiply q by 10 and print the result.

All parts done in juypter file in hw3 folder.

Created a Hw5_LoganGarcia folder and also added HW5 PDF to the folder and commited it to main.

Problem 1 (5 points). Make a new folder named hw5_<yourname>.  
For this homework your main homework file is a Python file named  
hw5_<username>.ipynb.  Save it in your homework folder. Remember to commit  
your files and push to GitHub (also, great backup!). Your name, assignment number,  
and the date should appear as comments at the top of the notebook. At the start of  
every problem, write the problem number using markdown comments. Any remarks or  
written answers you may make should also be written with markdown. If you need to  
comment something in the code (for coding clarity) do so with a normal comment (i.e., #  
this is a comment). Print the problem number (as in ‚ÄúProblem 1:‚Äù) before each  
problem‚Äôs output. Use the print() function to print, don‚Äôt just type the expression.  
 
Start your notebook by importing numpy.

Problem 2 (15 points).  Recall the quadratic formula ùë• =‚àíùëè¬±‚àöùëè2‚àí4ùëéùëê
2ùëé , which solves for 
the roots of  ùëéùë•2 +ùëèùë•+ùëê =0. Write a function that calculates and returns a list 
containing both of the roots, given the three coefficients. Be sure to include a docstring! 
What does it need to include? Calculate the roots of ùë•2 ‚àíùë•‚àí12 =0, returning them 
directly into two variables. Print them. 

This problem gave me issues so i skipped it after some time.

Problem 3 (10 points).  Create a list student_h that contains lists with the heights of 
students in feet and inches. A person being 5' 6" would be noted as [5, 6], a person 
being 5' 10" would be noted as [5, 10] etc. Populate it with the heights of five students 
who are : 5‚Äô 1‚Äù, 4‚Äô 10‚Äù, 6‚Äô 02‚Äù, 5‚Äô 07‚Äù, and 6‚Äô 11‚Äù.  
Create a function ft_to_m_cm that takes as input a value from student_h and  
returns each height in a new list [m, cm] (round cm up). Call the function for all values of  
student_h and print the results with an informative sentence (e.g., Student 1 has a  
height of 1 m 10 cm )  (Remember that 1 ft ~= 0.3048 m and 1 inch ~= 0.0254 m and  
1m has 100cm). 

For this problem i got everything to work, except the print statement.

Problem 4 (20 points). Create a function displacement(u_init, t ,a) that 
calculates the total displacement of a body during a time interval t, when the body has 
initial speed u_init and a constant acceleration a. Save it in a separate .py file, not 
your main homework file. Remember to start the function with a proper docstring.  
The displacement of a body that moves with a constant acceleration will be:  
s=u_init*t+0.5*a*t2, where t is the total time the object moves, a the  
constant acceleration and u_init the initial speed of the body. In your main homework  
file import the function and calculate the total displacement for u_init=0, a=[10, 
20, 30] and t=[2,4,14]. Again, calculate these numbers some other way to check 
that they are correct, and write on your log how you checked it. 


Problem 5 (10 points).  Prepare and submit your homework. Copy the finalized Jupyter  
notebook to the handin/hw5_* folder and don‚Äôt forget to commit and push it to  
GitHub. Explain what you did to do that in your log. Make a screenshot that shows you  
committed the file and add it to your handin/hw5_* folder (remember to use an  
appropriate name for the screenshot!). Write what you did to make and submit the zip  
file into your log. When satisfied, close the log, copy it to your homework directory one  
last time, and make the zip file. Turn the file in on WebCourses. 

Commit everything to main and upload to github, and then took the file on my computer and compressed it to a Zipfile and then submitted to webcourses.
